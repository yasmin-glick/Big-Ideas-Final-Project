Wellbeing can consist of having a good education, having a good mental/physical health, and feeling safe. These three datasets hit all of these marks.\n",

The best index, \"good,\" is air quality that is measured from an index of 0-50 with 0 being the best as there is no dangerous pollution in the air, so we are measuring the air quality index value to determine the neighborhood with the best air quality.
